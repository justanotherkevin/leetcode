# 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

## Problem Breakdown

Given a binary tree, we need to return its level-order traversal as a list of lists, where each inner list contains the values of nodes at that level from left to right.

### Example:
```
Input: 
    3
   / \
  9  20
     / \
    15  7

Output: [[3], [9,20], [15,7]]
```

### Constraints:
- Number of nodes: [0, 2000]
- Node values: [-1000, 1000]

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level 1 (Remember/Knowledge)

Basic knowledge questions to test understanding of fundamental concepts:

### Binary Tree Basics
1. What is a binary tree?
   - Answer: A tree data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as left and right child.

2. What is a node in a binary tree?
   - Answer: A data structure that contains:
     * A value (or data)
     * A pointer/reference to left child (or null)
     * A pointer/reference to right child (or null)

### Traversal Concepts
3. What is level-order traversal?
   - Answer: A way to visit tree nodes level by level, from left to right at each level, starting from the root.

4. What is the difference between level-order and other tree traversals (pre-order, in-order, post-order)?
   - Answer: Level-order visits nodes breadth-first (level by level), while others traverse depth-first (branch by branch).

### Data Structure Knowledge
5. What is a queue data structure?
   - Answer: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are:
     * Added at the end (enqueue)
     * Removed from the front (dequeue)

6. Why is a queue particularly useful for level-order traversal?
   - Answer: It maintains the order of processing nodes level by level, ensuring we process parent nodes before their children.

### Basic Operations
7. What are the basic operations needed for this problem?
   - Answer:
     * Queue operations (enqueue, dequeue)
     * List operations (append)
     * Null checks
     * Loop control

### Edge Cases
8. What are the edge cases to remember for this problem?
   - Answer:
     * Empty tree (null root)
     * Single node tree
     * Complete binary tree
     * Skewed tree (only left or right children)

## Key Insight 

The core concept here is Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal of a tree. We need to:
1. Process nodes level by level
2. Keep track of which nodes belong to the same level
3. Maintain left-to-right order within each level

What makes this problem interesting:
- Need to group nodes by their levels while traversing
- Need to handle edge cases (null/empty tree)
- Need to maintain correct left-to-right order of nodes at each level
- Queue data structure is perfect for this as it maintains FIFO order

## Optimized Solution

### Approach: BFS with Queue
We'll use a queue to process nodes level by level:

1. Initialize queue with root node
2. For each level:
   - Get current queue size (= number of nodes at current level)
   - Process that many nodes from queue
   - For each node:
     - Add its value to current level array
     - Add its children to queue (left then right)
   - Add current level array to result

### Python Implementation:
```python
from collections import deque
'''
A deque stands for Double-Ended Queue. 
It is a data structure that allows adding and removing elements from both ends efficiently. 
Unlike regular queues, which are typically operated on using FIFO (First In, First Out) principles, 
a deque supports both FIFO and LIFO (Last In, First Out) operations.
'''
class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if not root:
            return []
            
        result = []
        queue = deque([root])
        
        while queue:
            level_size = len(queue)
            current_level = []
            
            # Process all nodes at current level
            for _ in range(level_size):
                node = queue.popleft()
                current_level.append(node.val)
                
                # Add children to queue
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
                    
            result.append(current_level)
            
        return result
```

### Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(n) where n is number of nodes
  - Each node is processed exactly once
- Space Complexity: O(w) where w is maximum width of tree
  - Queue will contain at most w nodes at any time
  - w is at most n/2 for a complete binary tree
